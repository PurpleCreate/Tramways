**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS VERSION DOES NOT SUPPORT CREATE 6.0.0 OR ABOVE, TRAMWAYS WILL SUPPORT CREATE 6 IN THE FUTURE ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**‚ö†Ô∏è It is advised that you create a backup of your world before updating as some weird (one-time) data migration stuff will occur, data loss (should any occur) should only affect tram/railway signs ‚ö†Ô∏è**

## üî® Fixes

- Fixed server crash on fabric ([#5](https://github.com/PurpleCreate/Tramways/issues/5))
- Added missing ponder language entries
- Fixed signs not working in unloaded chunks
- Blocks added by the mod now break faster with tools (e.g. pickaxe, axe)
- Sign track points now get removed properly when the sign gets removed (if you placed a sign, removed it, and tried to place, for example, a signal on the same bit of track, it wouldn't let you)
- Remove the step on primary speed limit for more precise control
- Do not announce waypoints (Create: Steam 'n' Rails)
