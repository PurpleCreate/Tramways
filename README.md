Create: Tramways adds a bunch of tram-related features. These features mainly
relate to signalling and signage used on UK tramways and railways.

**Warning:** This mod probably contains a lot of bugs, so backups are a good
idea. If you do find a bug, please report it!

## Installation

**Important:** The game ***WILL CRASH*** if you do not install `ffmpeg`.

1. Install the mod like any other one: by dragging the downloaded `.jar` into
   your `.minecraft/mods` folder.
2. Make sure you have [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and added to
   your `PATH` (Try searching for a tutorial).
